# Secure Secret Sharing Tool - Dependencies
#
# This tool is designed to use ONLY Python standard library modules
# for maximum security and minimal attack surface.
#
# The following are OPTIONAL dependencies that can enhance functionality
# but are NOT required for core operation:

# Optional: Enhanced clipboard functionality
# pyperclip>=1.8.0

# Optional: Network interface detection for air-gap verification
# psutil>=5.8.0

# Optional: Enhanced GUI styling (already included in tkinter)
# Note: tkinter is part of Python standard library

# Development dependencies (for testing and development only):
# pytest>=6.0.0
# black>=21.0.0
# flake8>=3.8.0

# SECURITY NOTE:
# For maximum security in production environments:
# 1. Use only Python standard library (no external dependencies)
# 2. Manually verify all code before execution
# 3. Use on air-gapped systems only
# 4. Conduct independent security audit
